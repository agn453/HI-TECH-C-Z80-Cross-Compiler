To create a ROM type library:

Compile all the .C files here:

zc -O -x -c *.c

Then replace them in the library,

libr r zlibc.lib *.obj

You may also need to edit, recompile, and replace in the library
the file getch.c from cpm.huf. This has routines to input and output
single characters. It currently uses bdos calls to do it, so you may
need to change it to access a serial port or whatever.
